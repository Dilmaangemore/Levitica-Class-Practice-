        <p><strong>Water</strong> is an <a href="">inorganic compound</a> with the chemical formula <a href="">H<sub>2</sub>O</a>. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless,[a] and nearly colorless chemical substance, and it is the main constituent of Earth's <a href="">hydrosphere</a> and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[1]). It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy, or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one <a href="">oxygen</a> and two <a href="">hydrogen</a> atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45¬∞.[2] <strong>"Water"     </strong> is also the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard temperature and pressure.
        <br><br>

        Because Earth's environment is relatively close to water's triple point, water exists on Earth as a solid, liquid, and gas.[3] It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.

        <br><br>

        Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, with seas and oceans making up most of the water volume (about 96.5%).[4] Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%).[5][6] Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.

        <br><br>

        Water plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture.[7] Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies has been, and continues to be, a major source of food for many parts of the world, providing 6.5% of global protein.[8] Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances, both mineral and organic; as such, it is widely used in industrial processes and in cooking and washing. Water, ice, and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating, and skiing.

        Water (H2O) is a polar inorganic compound. At room temperature it is a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless with a hint of blue. This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the "universal solvent" for its ability to dissolve many substances.[10][11] This allows it to be the "solvent of life":[12] indeed, water as found in nature almost always includes various dissolved substances, and special steps are required to obtain chemically pure water. Water is the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas in normal terrestrial conditions.[13]

    <h3>states</h3>
    <p>
        Along with oxidane, water is one of the two official names for the chemical compound H
2O;[14] it is also the liquid phase of H
2O.[15] The other two common states of matter of water are the solid phase, ice, and the gaseous phase, water vapor or steam. The addition or removal of heat can cause phase transitions: freezing (water to ice), melting (ice to water), vaporization (water to vapor), condensation (vapor to water), sublimation (ice to vapor) and deposition (vapor to ice).<sup>[16]</sup>

    <h3>Density</h3>
    <p>
        See also: <a href="">Frost weathering</a><br><br>

        Water differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as it freezes.[b] In 1 atm pressure, it reaches its maximum density of 999.972 kg/m3 (62.4262 lb/cu ft) at 3.98 ¬∞C (39.16 ¬∞F), or almost 1,000 kg/m3 (62.43 lb/cu ft) at almost 4 ¬∞C (39 ¬∞F).[18][19] The density of ice is 917 kg/m3 (57.25 lb/cu ft), an expansion of 9%.[20][21] This expansion can exert enormous pressure, bursting pipes and cracking rocks.[22]
        
        In a lake or ocean, water at 4 ¬∞C (39 ¬∞F) sinks to the bottom, and ice forms on the surface, floating on the liquid water. This ice insulates the water below, preventing it from freezing solid. Without this protection, most aquatic organisms residing in lakes would perish during the winter.[23]
